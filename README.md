IPv4 Util
=========

I've created this library cause I needed some of these functions in one of my Arduino
projects. And, cause I'm such a nice guy, I figured I could share them with you. ;)

Installation
------------
Put all these files in a directory called `IPv4Util` inside your Arduino library folder.
